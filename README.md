### Project Description

**FileSearchTool** is a PowerShell-based utility designed to streamline the process of searching for files across the system. It leverages the .NET Framework's System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing assemblies to provide a graphical user interface (GUI), enhancing user experience by offering a more interactive and intuitive way of file searching compared to traditional command-line tools. This tool is especially useful for users who prefer a visual approach to file management and operations.

### Use Cases

- **General File Searching**: Ideal for users who need to quickly locate files without remembering complex command-line queries. It supports searching by various criteria, making it versatile for different scenarios.
- **IT and System Administration**: System administrators can use FileSearchTool to manage files across multiple systems, ensuring efficient file organization and accessibility.
- **Data Management**: Useful for managing large datasets or archives by enabling efficient search operations, thereby reducing the time spent on manual searches.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: Assists in generating reports or documentation by locating relevant files swiftly.
